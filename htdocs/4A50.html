<h1>4A50 bank-switching specification (semi-final)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

The 4A50 bank-switching method provides new and previously-unavailable 
programming flexibility to the Atari 2600.  It allows programs to use 64K of 
ROM and 32K of RAM with previously-unparalleled flexibility.  The hardware 
address space of the cartridge is divided into six primary regions: 

<table border=1>

<tr><td>0071-007F, 00F4-00FF

<td>Zero-page hotspots.  Bank-switch modes may be selected by reading or
writing addresses in this range.

<tr><td>0400-0FFF

<td>Soft-switch hotspots.  A read access to any of these addresses will
trigger a mode switch *IF* the last byte fetched before the read was $60-$6F.
Note that when using most addressing modes, this effectively means that the
hotspots will appear at $6400-$6FFF but not at any other "mirrors" of those
addresses.  Not all addresses in this range are used; access to any unused
address in the $6400-$6FFF range is forbidden.  Although the cartridge will
respond to the $6400-$6FFF hotspots, it will not output any data on the bus,
so the data read will be likely be meaningless.


<tr><td>1000-17FF

<td>This 2K region may access any 2K region of RAM, or of the first 32K of ROM.

<tr><td>1800-1DFF

<td>This 1.5K region may access the first 1.5K of any 2K region of RAM, or of 
the last 32K of ROM.

<tr><td>1E00-1EFF

<td>This 256-byte region may point to any 256-byte page of RAM or ROM.

<tr><td>1F00-1FFF

<td>This 256-byte region will always access the last 256 bytes of ROM.  If 
accessed at addresses $7F00-$7FFF, these addresses will also act as a "hi-res
helper" hotspots.

</table>

<b>Note that some actions are listed as "forbidden".  It is recommended that
emulators trap on these conditions, as there is no guarantee that they will
be implemented consistently on future revisions of the cartridge.</b>

<h2>Identification</h2>
The NMI vector (bytes $1FFA-$1FFB) of any 4A50-bankswitched cartridge should
point to address $4A50.  Since this would never be used for any normal
cartridge, this should provide an effective means of identifying carts that
require $4A50 bankswitching.  Addresses $FFF8-$FFF9 should contain the sub-
version of the scheme required.  First revision is $0001, stored LSB first.

<h2>Memory Access</h2>

Most memory accesses work as would be expected subject to the notes above.
Unlike most 2600 RAM+carts, RAM may be read and written at the same address
without restriction.  Soft-switch hotspots, however, operate somewhat 
unusually: for a soft-switch hotspot access to register, it must be preceded by a memory 
access which is not in the usual hotspot range and which fetches a byte value of 
011xxxxx.  This has two useful effects: 

<ol>

<li>A BIT instruction which hits a hotspot won't trigger it unless the MSB of 
the address is $60-$7F.  This reduces the risk of triggering a hotspot by 
accident when using BIT to skip over instructions. 

<li>When accessing hotspots with indexed addressing modes, page 
crossings will not advance from one hotspot range to the next.  For example, the 
instruction "CMP $6CF0,y" with Y=32 will hit the hotspot at $6C10 and will not 
hit the hotspot at $6D10.  Note that the instruction in that case will take a 
cycle longer than in the non-page-crossing case.

</ol>

<h2>Memory "presets"</h2>
There are three types of memory preset hotspots.  Addresses $F4,$F6, $FC, and
$FE will switch the upper address bank to the flash page specified by the value 
read/written.  $F5, $F7, $FD, and $FF will swith the upper address bank to the
RAM page specified by the value read/written.  $F4-$F7 will switch the lower or
middle memory block based upon the value read/written (bit 7 of the value
indicates whether to switch the lower or middle memory block; bit 6 indicates
whether to select a flash or RAM block; the lower bits indicate which block to
select).  When selecting ROM for the lower address block, one must select 
blocks 0-15; for the middle address block, one must select blocks 16-31.  
Selecting other blocks may have unpredictable results.<p>

Each of the memory presets will function both as a bank-switch trigger and as
a byte of normal RAM.  Because of this dual functionality, it's possible to
switch among a small group of banks fairly quickly--simply store their page
or block addresses into the hotspots first, then read them via the "NOP zp"
instruction to select them.  The four addresses within each group will behave
interchangeably as far as bank-switching is concerned, but are 'backed' by
four different bytes of RAM.<p>

Note that accessing these bytes of RAM will trigger bankswitches only if the
accesses are done in page zero (or, more precisely, when A8-A12 are all zero,
since the cartridge can't see A13-A15).  Thus, it is possible to store values
into these RAM locations without triggering bank switching by storing at a
shadow address ($01F4-$01FF is the recommended choice).  The CLEAN_START macro
commonly used with DASM actually does its stores in the $0100-$01FF range, and
will thus not trigger any bankswitching.


<h2>1E00 page wrap</h2>

Instructions which cross pages from $1Exx to $1Fxx (e.g. LDA $1EFF,x with X not 
equal to zero) will trigger the $1Fxx bank switch if and only if the byte value 
at $1Exx happens to be $6x or $7x.  Such page crossing should generally be 
avoided.

<h2>The BIT/skip instruction</h2>

Because the BIT instruction $2C is frequently used to skip other 
instructions, and will generate a memory fetch whose address corresponds to 
the instructions skipped, it is important to add this caution: <i>Do not use 
BIT to skip over an instruction whose second byte is in the range $60-$7F.</i>.
If I had the logic, I would have harmlessly disabled the BIT absolute
instruction from causing any bank switching, and in future cart revisions I may 
do so.  Thus, use of bit absolute instructions with an address of $6000-$7FFF is 
forbidden.  If you wish to trigger a bank switch without affecting any other 
registers, use the "NOP abs" instruction (or, if you prefer, "NOP abs,x") 

<h2>Using the hires helpers</h2>
The 4A50 bankswitching contains a couple of special hotspot ranges that are 
optimized for use with Stella-Sketch-style graphics.  Assuming that each 
column of data occupies a single page, and that the even columns are in one 
bank and the odd colums in another, one may draw very quickly by placing the 
proper data at $7F00-$7FF7 and using the following code.  X coordinates are
assumed to run $0000-$0077, with the visible portion being $0010-$006F (this
allows for graphics to slightly overrun the visible screen on either side
without ill effect).<p>

<b>Table setup</b><br>

<tt>$7F00: Sixteen 00 bytes, then 12 copies of (01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80), 
then eight 00 bytes, then eight code bytes (see below).<br>
$7F80: Sixteen FF bytes, then 12 copies of (FE FD FB F7 EF DF BF 7F), 
then eight 00 bytes, then eight bytes for vectors etc.</tt><p>

<b>Pixel plotting/erasure</b><br>
<pre>; Plot pixel at X,Y
  lda $7F00,x
  ora $1E00,y
  sta $1E00,y

; Erase pixel at X,Y
  lda $7F80,x
  and $1E00,y
  sta $1E00,y</pre>

Note that plotted pixels will go into pages 1-6 of a 2K bank; if the X 
coordinate stays within the range 0-119, pages 0 and 7 will be unaffected.  

<h2>Code at $1E00-$1FFF</h2>
It is recommended that a minimal amount of code be stored in the last page.
Running code from this region may cause the region from $1E00-$1EFF to be
bank-switched, so the status of that page should not be relied upon.  The
recommended use of the last page is to put the format version and vectors 
at $FFF8, and put the startup code at $FF78.  The code there should simply
be a read of a bank-switch address to set the lower or middle block to point
to a known ROM bank, followed by a JMP to the start of user code in that
other block.<p>

Code may be run from $1E00-$1EFF, but such code should not make any access to
the $1F00-$1FFF memory page, whether at the hotspot address or not.


<h2>Compatibility notes</h2>

Because I'm trying to fit everything into a Xilinx XC9536XL, I had to leave
off some features I would have liked to include.  It's possible a future
version of the cart based upon a different chip may include these features.
If software is written properly, it should work correctly with or without
them.  In particular:

<dl>
<dt>Lower and middle bank address MSB
<dd>I had to leave off the MSB of the flash address for the lower and middle
bank; the lower bank has it hard-coded as "0"; the middle bank has it as "1".
Future versions of the chip may allow the full address to be set.  Thus, for
compatibility, programs should always act as though the upper bit will be
meaningful.  When setting a flash address using $7C, for example, always set
the MSB even though the present cartridge design ignores it.  Then the code
will work even if a future cartridge design uses it.
<dt>BIT instruction
<dd>I would have liked to prevent any bank-switching from occurring in response 
to a "BIT abs" instruction, but didn't have the chip resources to do that.  If
I  do implement such protection, the only time a hotspot will respond will be
if (1) the third-to-last memory access as NOT a $2C, or (2) if the hot-spot in
question was a zero-page hotspot and the last memory byte fetched was a
$F4-$FF.  This would allow the BIT instruction to be used to skip over any 
two bytes, without restriction.  To prevent this from causing compatibility 
problems with future versions of the bank-switching scheme, do not use "BIT
abs" to trigger a bank switch.  Use "NOP abs" instead.  Note that there is no 
restriction on use of BIT zero-page instructions.
<dt>Zero-page hotspots and absolute mode
<dd>The zero-page hotspots will presently respond to address $x071-$x07F and
$x0F4-$x0FF (with 'x' being even).  This may change in a future version.  They 
should be used with zero-page direct addressing mode only; future versions may 
enforce this. 
<dt>Zero-page indexed addressing
<dd>When performing zero-page indexed operations, the 6502 will perform an
'unindexed' read prior to operating at the correct address.  If the address
specified in the instruction was a hotspot, this could trigger an unwanted bank 
switch.  Future cartridges may protect against this behavior, so it should not 
be relied upon.

<h2>Other code samples</h2>

To illustrate some other aspects of the 4A50's flexibility, compare these code
samples with what would be required on other carts:<p>
<b>Bulk memory copying</b><p>
Although for some purposes, the larger banks are convenient, the 256-byte size 
of the smaller page can often be an asset in its own way.
<pre>; Copy some pages of data from flash to RAM.
; The MSB of the source address is in X
; The MSB of the destination address is in Y
; The number of pages is in the accumulator.

        stx $FE
        sty $FF
        sec
        bcs entry2
loop1:
        ldx #0
        pha
loop2:
        nop $FE ; Use source page
        lda $1E00,x
        ldy $1E80,x
        nop $FF ; Use destination page
        sta $1E00,x
        sty $1E80,x
        inx
        bpl loop2
        pla
        inc $FE
        inc $FF
entry2:
        sbc #1
        bcs loop1
</pre>
Perhaps the most interesting thing to note here is that the bank switches were 
performed without having to load the page addresses into registers.  There are 
twelve zero-page bank-switching hotspots; one may freely switch banks using them 
merely by reading them.<p>

It should be noted that the hotspots $00F4-$00FF use the same RAM as
$01F4-$01FF, but reads or writes to the latter range of addresses will not 
trigger hotspots.  Thus, if a programmer wishes to use only the top six hotspot 
addresses, the stack pointer may safely be set to $F9.  Pushes and pops to/from 
addresses $01F4-$01F9 will not trigger bank switching.<p>

<b>High-resolution shape drawing</b><p>
These simple code bits for drawing/erasing pixels may easily be used to draw 
larger shapes.  The following, for example, might be used to draw explosions in 
a Stella-sketch-kernel missile defense game (this code is quite similar to what 
I use in my Minigame entry, except that I call subroutines for pixel plotting).
<pre>; Draw a hexagon with diagonal sides of length 'size' and vertical sides of
; length 'size'*2.  Assumes X,Y is at center.

</pre>
Not sure if I got all the terminating cases right, but examination of the code 
will reveal that it's pretty simple for a polygon-draw procedure WITH NO
SUBROUTINE CALLS.  The code moves from one point to the next with nothing more
than an 'iny', 'inx', 'dey', or 'dex.  Makes rapid drawing of shapes a snap.
