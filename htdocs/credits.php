      <p>Many people have helped in some capacity with Stella development over the years.
      Some provided technical help while others have offered suggestions and praise,
      or donated hardware to help the project.  The Stella Team is grateful for all the
      help and support it has received over the years.  The following is a (likely
      incomplete) list of the people who have played a part in bringing Stella to you:
