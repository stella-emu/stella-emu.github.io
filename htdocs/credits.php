      <p>Many people have helped in some capacity with Stella development over the years.
      Some provided technical help while others have offered suggestions and praise,
      or donated hardware to help the project.  The Stella Team is grateful for all the
      help and support it has received over the years.  The following is a (likely
      incomplete) list of the people who have played a part in bringing Stella to you:

      <td>Original author and creator of Stella.  The inspiration for the entire project,
      it goes without saying that without Brad, there would be no Stella project at all.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Stephen&nbsp;Anthony<br>(<a href="http://minbar.org">http://minbar.org</a>)</th>
      <td>Ported Stella 1.1 to SDL.  Added extra command line options to X11/SDL
      versions.  Added INI file support, faster startup, snapshot support,
      and pause functionality to core.  Converted Stella 1.1 manual to HTML.
      Ported codebase to SDL for Windows/MacOSX.  Added OpenGL support and
      Stelladaptor/2600-daptor support. Current maintainer for the Linux, MacOSX and Windows
      versions.</td>

      effect in Cosmic Ark, provided the PAL television palette, and
      participated in a helpful discussion on understanding the TIA's RESPx
      multi-sprite trick.  Provided the Commavid, Megaboy, 4A50 and X07 support

    <tr>
      <th>Brian&nbsp;Watson (retired)</th>
      <td>Helped with getting the illegal CPU instruction support working with Stella.
      Brian also submitted a number of other changes, such as debugger support, which
      have been finally integrated into the 2.0 release of Stella.  Without
      a doubt, there would be no debugger support in Stella if not for the
      tireless work of Brian.</td>
