      <h2>Stella is DonationWare!</h2>

      <p>As of release 3.5, Stella is officially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donationware">DonationWare.</a>
      What is DonationWare, you may ask?  Simply put, the concept of donationware is
      where the developer requests donations that indicate appreciation for the project,
      and as an incentive to continue work on the project.</p>

      <p>So who am I?  My name is <a href="http://minbar.org">Stephen Anthony</a>, and
      I've maintained Stella exclusively for
      the last few years.  While I did have help many years ago (and owe a huge debt to
      Brad Mott, original Stella creator), I've been working on the project alone for
      quite some time.  I've personally added over 10000 lines of code to Stella, and
      coordinated several large merges from other projects (ScummVM for parts of the GUI,
      Distella for the debugger disassembler, etc).  I've also created the <b>Harmony
      Programming Tool</b> software for the <a href="http://harmony.atariage.com">Harmony
      Cartridge</a>, and created a version of the <a href="http://www.arminvogl.de/KrokodileCartridge">KrokCom</a>
      software for Linux/OSX - <a href="http://krokcom.sourceforge.net">KrokCom for UNIX</a>.
      So as you can see, I'm quite prolific in Atari 2600 development.</p>

      <p>Let me say up-front that donating is completely voluntary.  Stella is an open-source /
      free software project, and will remain so because of its license (GPLv/2).  It's
      not my intent to guilt anyone into donations, or to threaten that the project will
      be discontinued if I don't receive any.  Donations are simply a way for appreciative
      end-users to demonstrate their enjoyment of Stella, and to make me feel a little
      better about the long hours spent on this project.</p>

      <p>I'll list a few reasons why you might want to make a donation:
      <ul>
        <li>I've been involved with this project for over 10 years; I can't even begin
        to estimate how much time I've invested in this project, but it is <b>easily</b>
        in the 1000's of hours!</li>
        <li>My number one goal for Stella is cross-platform compatibility; if at
        all possible, nobody will be left behind</li>
        <li>Stella is one of the few (only?) Atari 2600 emulators still under active development</li>
        <li>One of the main goals of Stella is to help homebrew developers; as such, Stella
        contains an actively developed <a href="docs/debugger.html">built-in debugger</a>
        that IMHO is <b>unrivaled</b></li>
        <li>You're a homebrew developer who feels that Stella has helped greatly in your
        development efforts</li>
        <li>If you just want to fire it up and play a game, the process is as plug and play
        as possible</li>
        <li>To see your name in print in the <a href="credits.php">Credits</a>
        section of the manual :)</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>What type of donations would I consider?  I'm firmly of the opinion that <i>beggars
      can't be choosers</i>.  That being said, I'm listing some of the things I'd like
      to receive (in no particular order):
      <ul>
        <li>Esoteric controllers, such as a MindLink, BoosterGrip, Trakball, KidVid, etc.</li>
        <li>For appreciative homebrew developers, a copy of your released cart</li>
        <li>2600 carts, particularly those of rarer vintage, or in any case with manuals
        and/or boxes</li>
        <li>Magazines or books on 2600-related stuff</li>
        <li>2600 consoles (heavy-sixer, light-sixer, Vader, Jr, etc.)</li>
        <li>Anything 7800 related; I'm beginning to get into the 7800 scene, and have
        just the console and a few games at this point</li>
        <li>Anything Atari-computer related, such as an Atari 400, 800, ST, etc</li>
        <li>Anything Amiga related; seriously, this isn't related to the Atari at all,
        but the Amiga is another retro-love of mine</li>
        <li>A <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/c128d.html">Commodore 128D</a>; I know this is an extreme longshot, but I'll throw it
        out there anyway</li>
        <li>Anything else retro-related that you think is cool</li>
        <li>Cash donations</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Note that I've ranked money at the bottom of the list.  This isn't a mistake.
      While I appreciate any monetary donations I might receive, I'm not in this for the money.
      If I was, I would have abandoned the project after the first year. :)</p>

      <p>If you're interested in making a donation, please
      <a href="mailto:stephena@users.sourceforge.net">contact me by email</a>.
      I can provide shipping details, Paypal address, etc.  Note that I'm located in
      Canada, so your location in the world might cause some shipping issues.</p>

      <h3>Thanks in advance for any donations I may receive, and for all past donations.
      Let's help keep the Atari 2600 scene alive.</h3>
