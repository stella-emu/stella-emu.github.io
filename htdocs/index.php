				<p>The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977,
				was the most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.&nbsp;
				Now you can enjoy all of your favorite Atari 2600 games on your PC
				thanks to Stella!</p>
				
				<p>Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator released under
				the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Stella was originally developed
				for Linux by <a href="http://www.bradfordmott.com/">Bradford W. Mott</a>,
				however, since its original release several people have joined the
				development team to port Stella to other operating systems such as
				AcornOS, AmigaOS, DOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, OS/2, MacOS, Unix, and
				Windows.  The development team is working hard to perfect the emulator
				and we hope you enjoy our effort.</p>
				
				<p>On this site you'll find information about downloading, installing,
				using, and enhancing Stella.&nbsp; You'll also find useful information
				about the Atari 2600, emulation and homebrew development.</p>
