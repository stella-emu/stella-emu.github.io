  <a name="History">A Brief History of the Atari 2600</a></h1>
  <hr>

  <p><a><img src="graphics/console.png" ALIGN=RIGHT></a>
  In the early 1970's, video arcade games gained commercial success for the
  first time. The American public was introduced to Pong, Tank, and other
  interactive video games which populated amusement parks, bars, and arcades.
  The games were successful enough to create interest for home versions, so in
  1975 Atari released Home Pong and it was a smash hit. Other companies such as
  Magnavox and Coleco followed suit and released their own dedicated console
  games. Then in 1976, Fairchild Camera and Instrument introduced the Channel F
  system, the first cartridge based home video game system. The industry
  recognized that cartridge systems were the future of video gaming, and began
  development in that direction. In January 1977, RCA released the Studio II,
  another cartridge based system, although it only projected in black and white
  and seemed to be focused on educational titles. Then, in October 1977, Atari
  released the Atari VCS (Video Computer System) with an initial offering of nine
  games. This system, later renamed the Atari 2600, took the industry by storm
  and dominated the marketplace for years to come.
  </p>

  <p><a><img src="graphics/chucky_cheese.png" ALIGN=LEFT></a>
  Because of oversupply, the Christmas season of 1977 was very rough on the
  video game industry, and the Atari 2600 was the only system that managed to
  emerge unscathed. Atari enjoyed strong sales in 1978 and a fantastic holiday
  season, as Atari released more games such as Outlaw, Spacewar, and Breakout.
  Internally however, Atari was at odds. Nolan Bushnell, the inventor of pong and
  founder of Atari, wound up leaving the company and purchased Pizza Time Theater,
  which later became the successful Chuck E. Cheese! In 1979 Atari continued
  their trend and released 12 more games which met with continued success.
  However, Atari was now facing some stiffer competition from the Mattel
  Intellivision and the Magnavox Odyssey2.
  </p>

  <p><a><img src="graphics/space_invaders.png" ALIGN=RIGHT></a>
  Atari needed a mega-hit in 1980 in order to squash the competition, and they
  found it in the home version of a game from Japan called Space Invaders. It was
  so popular that people were buying the Atari 2600 just so they could play Space
  Invaders at home. Following that, Atari released Adventure, which was the first
  video game to contain an Easter Egg - placing an object in a certain area
  revealed the programmer's name, Warren Robinett. 1980 was important for another
  reason - the creation of the first ever third party software producer, Activision.
  The company was formed by four Atari employees who were unsatisfied with the
  working conditions at the company. They released four games initially: Dragster,
  Fishing Derby, Checkers and Boxing. The games were very well received by the
  public, and revealed that the Atari 2600 was capable of better games than
  Atari themselves had been producing. Atari tried to prevent Activision from
  selling games, but they failed and Activision grossed $70 million that year.
  </p>

  <p>
  By 1981, the video game industry was basically a horse race between the 2600
  and the Intellivision. While the Intellivision was technologically superior in
  some respects, the 2600 continued to lead in sales. Atari released the home
  version of Asteroids, which was a huge success. Inspired by the success of
  Activision, another software development group called Imagic was formed. They
  would not release any games until 1982 however. Another company, Games by Apollo,
  was formed in Texas and released several games that year.
  </p>

  <p>
  Coleco entered the market in 1982 with the release of the graphically
  superior Colecovision. To combat this new system, Atari produced the 5200,
  a technologically comparable system. The 2600 dropped $100 in price in order
  to remain competitive. Then a company called Arcadia released a peripheral
  called the Supercharger which played games in an audio cassette medium. This
  allowed for multiple loads and expanded the 2600's capabilities.
  <p><a><img src="graphics/pacman.png" ALIGN=LEFT></a>
  Atari released Pac-Man and E.T. that year, two incredibly hyped games which
  were critical flops.
  Although Pac-Man sold many copies, it was considered to be a poor
  translation of the arcade hit. However, there were many fantastic games
  produced for the 2600 during this period, and it was still selling strong.
  </p>

  <p>
  Ever since the inception of Activision, Atari had been fighting to keep third
  parties from producing cartridges which they felt were stealing profits from
  them. Finally the issue was settled when Atari agreed to allow third party
  manufacturing in exchange for a royalty. Suddenly software companies began
  popping up all over, and 1982 saw releases from companies like Venturevision,
  Spectravision, Telesys, CBS, 20th Century Fox, US Games, M Network, Tigervision,
  Data Age, Imagic and Coleco. There was even a company that released a line of
  X-Rated games for the 2600 called Mystique. The year was financially successful 
  for Atari, however there seemed to be a glut of software. Although there were
  many quality titles still produced, there was an increasing number of rushed
  games as manufacturers attempted to cash in on the craze.
  </p>

  <p>
  More companies jumped on the band wagon in 1983. Zimag, Ultravision, Amiga,
  and others were also producing games and peripherals. It seemed as if there was
  just too much product to meet the demand, and as it turned out there was. By
  the end of the year, companies began folding. US Games, Data Age, Games by
  Apollo, Telesys and others all closed their doors from poor sales. A video
  game crash was occurring, and all companies were taking it on the chin.
  </p>

  <p>
  1984 was a much more subdued year for the Atari 2600, and the price of the
  system had now dropped to $40-$50. Many were saying that the video game
  industry was dead. However, Atari surprised everyone by announcing the release
  of the 7800, and also promising more 2600 games with improved graphics and
  sound. Unfortunately, neither of these things happened in 1984 because Atari
  sold their home video game division to Jack Tramiel who believed that home
  computers would replace video game systems. No further mention of the 2600 or
  7800 was made that year, and it appeared that they might be dead.
  </p>

  <p>
  1985 was another very quiet year for Atari and video games in general, and only
  a few games were released for the 2600. Activision produced Cosmic Commuter and
  Ghostbusters, but with little fanfare or marketing, these games did not sell
  well. However, because of the huge game library and cheap price, Atari still
  sold over a million 2600 consoles in 1985.
  </p>

  <p>
  There were very few plans for home video game systems by any company in 1986,
  since the market appeared to be dead. Then, to most people's surprise, Nintendo
  brought the NES to America and it was a smash hit, proving that video games
  still had a place in the US. Atari decided that maybe it would be a good idea
  to release the 7800 units it had in storage, and produce some more 2600 games.
  The 7800 was released with only 3 games initially available, although it was
  compatible with the 2600 library. They also redesigned the 2600 as the 2600 Jr.,
  a machine with the same abilities, but a new look and marketing campaign. It
  was sold for less than $50.
  </p>

  <p><a><img src="graphics/jr_pacman.png" ALIGN=RIGHT></a>
  Video games were once again selling phenomenally in 1987. Atari released
  several new titles, including Jr. Pac-Man, and also licensed a number of games
  from other companies such as Donkey Kong and Q*Bert. These new titles sold for
  $10-$15. Interestingly, a number of titles began appearing again from third
  part companies such as Epyx, Froggo, and Exus. It seemed that the 2600 was not
  dead yet!
  <p><a><img src="graphics/secret_quest.png" ALIGN=LEFT></a>
  In 1988, Atari rehired Nolan Bushnell and announced a number of new
  titles, including Secret Quest, a game written by Mr. Bushnell himself. Atari
  continued to manufacture these games even until 1989. However, it was apparent
  that the 2600, after its introduction over a decade ago, was finally at the end
  of its run. Although it was still produced and marketed outside of the US, the
  Atari 2600 finished its run in America. No other console has had such a long
  history or sold as many systems in the U.S.
  </p>

  <p>
  Today, the 2600 still has a large number of fans who remember the countless
  games played over the years, and the years to come. There are even games being
  produced by hobbyists, some of them quite professionally, being released on
  newly burnt cartridges with labels and manuals. And the recent trend in
  retrogaming has brought many more video game fans to rediscover the 2600, and
  it continues to live on 22 years after its release!

  <h2><b><a name="Games">3. Locating Game Images (aka, ROMs)</a></b></h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <h3><b><u>Cartridges</u></b></h3>

  <p>Most games for the Atari 2600 came on cartridges.  A cartridge usually
  consists of a single Read Only Memory (ROM) chip which contains the data and
  code for the game.  Plugging a cartridge into the Atari 2600 allows the 2600's
  microprocessor to access the program stored on the cartridge.</p>

  <p>In a similar way you must "plug" a copy of a cartridge into Stella when you
  want to play it.  Having a ROM image / BIN file, of the cartridge allows you to
  do this.  A ROM image is a file, which contains the actual data and code read
  from the cartridge.  There are several ways to obtain a ROM image of a
  cartridge:</p>

  <p><ul>
    <li>Search around the internet and find ROM images to download (websites such
      as <a href="http://atariage.com">AtariAge</a> and
      <a href="http://www.atarimania.com/rom_collection_archive_atari_2600_roms.html">
      AtariMania/RomHunter</a> may be useful)</li>

    <li>You can purchase the Atari 2600 Action Packs by Activision and use
    their ROM images</li>

    <li>If you're handy with a soldering iron then you can design and build a
    device that plugs into the printer port of a PC and read the data from the
    cartridge</li>    
  </ul>

  <p><b>WARNING:</b> It is illegal to use ROM images of games that you do not
  actually own since these games are still copyrighted.</p>

  <p>
  <h3><b><u>Supercharger Cassettes</u></b></h3>

  <p>Supercharger games were not stored on cartridges instead they were stored
  on cassette tapes. The Supercharger, which plugged into the Atari 2600's
  cartridge slot, loaded games into its 6K of Random Access Memory (RAM) using a
  standard audio cassette player.  The Supercharger also supported multi-loading,
  which allowed games to be broken into several segments and loaded at different
  times.  This was useful for large games which had distinct parts such as role
  playing games.</p>

  <p>Most of the available Supercharger ROM images are stored in 8448 bytes files.
  However, ROM images of multi-load games are sometimes stored in a set of 8448
  byte files. The names of these files have a two character sequence number in
  them which indicates what load they are.  The sequence starts with zero, skips
  a few numbers and then increments by one.</p>

  <p>Stella supports multi-load games, however, the set of ROM images must be
  combined into a single ROM image file.  For example to create a multi-load ROM
  image file for Survival Island you would do the following under Unix:

  <pre>   % cat survivl0.bin survivl6.bin survivl7.bin > survivl.bin</pre>
  
  or to create it under DOS you would:

  <pre>   % copy /b survivl0.bin+survivl6.bin+survivl7.bin survivl.bin</pre>

  <p>Once you have the multi-load ROM image file, survivl.bin in this case, you
  can play the game using it.</p>

  <p>
  <h3><b><u>Supported File formats</u></b></h3>

  <p>Stella supports ROMs ending with extensions .a26, .bin, .rom, .gz, and .zip.
  For the last two compressed formats (GZIP and ZIP, respectively), Stella will
  automatically decompress the archive, and use the first ROM image it finds in
  it (ie, the first one ending in a valid extension).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Playing">4. Playing a Game</a></b></h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Once Stella is installed and you have some ROM images you're almost ready to
  start playing.</p>

  <p>
  <h3><b><u>Integrated GUI</u></b></h3>

  <p>Stella contains an integrated GUI for all ports.  Commandline support is also
  available for those who want to use it.</p>

  <p>If you start Stella and do not specify a ROM image, it will start in
  'ROM Launcher' mode:<br><br>
  <img src="graphics/launcher.png"></p>

  <p>If this is your first time starting Stella, you will be asked to select the
  default ROM directory to use.  This is where you have all your ROMs,
  collected as described in the previous section.  Several dialogs will be shown, similar
  to the following:</p>
  <p><img src="graphics/select_romdir.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="graphics/rom_browser.png"></p>

  <p>The browser should be self-explanatory.  The 'Go Up' button moves to the parent
  folder (if it exists), and the 'Base Dir' button moves to the base directory where,
  by default, all Stella-related files are stored.  Double-clicking an item will
  enter that directory.  Click 'Choose' to select the location, or 'Cancel' to exit
  the browser.  Note that if you don't select a ROM directory now, you will be prompted
  again the next time Stella is started.</p>

  <p>At this point, you may want to set the locations for snapshots and other
  external paths.  This is described in more detail in
  <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#ConfigFiles">Config Files</a></b>.
  These settings are optional, and can be left at the defaults if you won't be using
  snapshots in the ROM launcher.</p>

  <p>Once you've correctly set the default ROM directory, you can start emulation by
  selecting a ROM and pressing 'Enter' or clicking 'Select', or double-clicking a ROM.
  Note that some games require you to 'Reset' the console before you start playing.  In this
  case, you need to hit the virtual reset switch, which by default is the F2 key.
  Also, some games may require that you press the joystick fire button to begin,
  which by default is the Left Control or Space key(s).  If a game uses a
  more complex controller, see
  <b>Getting Started - <a href="#Keyboard">Keyboard Layout</a></b>
  for more information.  To exit a game and re-enter the ROM launcher, press the 'Escape'
  key.</p>

  <p>Using the 'Search' textbox in the upper-right of the ROM launcher, the
  listing can be narrowed down, showing only the ROMs that match the pattern
  you enter.</p>

  <p>
  <h3><b><u>Command Menu</u></b></h3>

  <p>While playing a game, normally one would use the keyboard shortcuts for controlling the 
  'virtual' switches in Stella (ie, the commands associated with the
  function keys as described in
  <b>Getting Started - <a href="#Keyboard">Keyboard Layout</a></b>).
  However, another alternative is available.  Pressing the '\' key toggles
  a command menu dialog as follows:</p>
  <p><img src="graphics/commandmenu.png"></p>

  <p>This dialog contains a set of buttons that represent the same functionality
  as the function keys.  You may find this useful if you cannot remember all
  the function key events, or you wish to use Stella without a keyboard (ie,
  in a standalone gaming system).</p>

  <h2><b><a name="Keyboard">5. Keyboard Layout</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>The Atari 2600 console controls and controllers are mapped to the computer's
  keyboard as shown in the following tables.  However, most of these events can be
  remapped to other keys on your keyboard or buttons on your joystick (see
  <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#Remapping">Event Remapping</a></b>).
  The tables below show the default settings.</p>

  <p><h1>
  <a name="Advanced">Advanced Configuration</a></h1>
  <hr>

  <p>The default options in Stella are meant to cater to as many situations as 
  possible.  As such, you may never need to change many of its options.  However,
  Stella is very configurable, and if you want to change its behaviour in some way,
  there's likely a configuration option to do so.  The remainder of this (lengthy)
  section details every configurable option.</p>

  <h2><b><a name="CommandLine">1. Using the Command Line</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>In addition to the built in ROM launcher, Stella can also be used from the
  commandline (assuming your operating system has a commandline).</p>

  <p>To run Stella from the commandline, use the following format:</p>

  <pre>   stella [options ...] ROM_FILENAME</pre>

  <p><b>Options</b> ('0' or 'false' indicates false, '1' or 'true' indicates true,
    others are self-explanatory):</p>

        probably be left blank.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><pre>-gl_filter &lt;nearest|linear&gt;</pre></td>
      <td>OpenGL mode only. Use GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR filtering.
        GL_NEAREST results in a scaled, pixelated image, while
        GL_LINEAR introduces blurring.</td>

      <td>OpenGL mode only. Specify the amount (as a percentage) to scale the
        TIA image width in NTSC and PAL mode. Since many video modes do not
        use square pixels, you can reduce width until the pixels appear square.
        Allowable values are 80 - 120; I find 85 - 90 gives the most authentic
        look for NTSC, and 105 - 110 for PAL.</td>

        Sleep will release the CPU as much as possible, and is the

  <h2><b><a name="Remapping">3. Event Remapping / Input Devices</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Almost every event in Stella can be remapped to another key on the keyboard or
  to buttons on up to eight joysticks/gamepads (see <b>Getting Started -
  <a href="#Keyboard">Keyboard Layout</a></b> for those events which can/cannot be
  remapped).</p>

  <p>Note that there are currently two separate event modes in Stella; emulation
  mode and user-interface (UI) mode.  Each mode has separate mappings, so (for example)
  while in emulation mode, the left arrow could mean 'joystick 0 left', while in UI
  mode it could mean 'move cursor left'.  Emulation mode occurs whenever you're
  actually playing a game.  UI mode occurs whenever a user interface is present
  (ROM launcher, debugger, settings menu, etc).  Because of these different modes,
  there are two separate mapping areas.

  <p>To remap an event:
  <ol>
    <li>Enter <b>Options menu</b> and click the <b>Input Settings</b> button.</li>
    <li>If you wish to remap emulation events, click the 'Emul. Events' tab.
      Otherwise, click the 'UI Events' tab for user interface events.</li>
    <li>Select event you want to remap and click the 'Map' button.</li>
    <li>Press a key or a joystick button, and that key/button will be bound
      to the selected event.  If nothing seems to happen, either Stella
      can't see the input device, or the selected event doesn't support being
      remapped to the input device.</li>
    <li>Cancel a remap in progress by clicking 'Cancel', erase a mapping by
      clicking 'Erase', or reset to default mapping by clicking 'Reset'</li>
    <li>Reset to default <b>all</b> mappings by clicking 'Defaults'.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following screenshots illustrate the event remapping process:<br><br>
  <img src="graphics/eventmapping.png">
  <img src="graphics/eventmapping_remap.png">

  <p>There is also a 'Combo' button in the 'Emulation Events' tab, accessible
  when a Combo event has been selected from the list of events on the left.
  Clicking 'Combo' will show a dialog similar to the following:</p>
  <img src="graphics/eventmapping_combo.png">
  <p>In this dialog, you can assign various events to the selected combo event.
  Note that this simply assigns multiple events to the combo; you still need
  to map the combo event itself to some action, as described in the 'remap an
  event' section above.</p>

  <h2><b><a name="ROMInfo">4. ROM Launcher</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Several options are configurable in the ROM launcher.  The size of the
  launcher and fonts, as well as the 'ROM info viewer' can be changed in
  <b>UI Settings =&gt; Launcher</b> dialog, as shown below:</p>
  <img src="graphics/launcher_options.png">
  <p>Most of the options are self-explanatory, except for the 'ROM Info
  viewer', which is described below.</p>

  <p>Stella supports viewing snapshots and ROM properties of the currently
  selected ROM in the ROM launcher.  Support is automatic, as long as your
  snapshot directory contains snapshots in the appropriate format.  An
  archive of updated snapshots will be available on the Stella webpage.
  This archive may be updated periodically as new ROMs are found, and also
  for each new release of Stella.  Note that the snapshots can be any size
  generated by Stella; they will be resized accordingly.</p>

  <p>Currently, there are several restrictions for this feature:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The ROM info viewer can be shown in 1x or 2x mode only.</li>
    <li>To view snapshots in 1x mode, the ROM launcher window must be sized at
      least 640x480.  If the launcher isn't large enough, the functionality
      will be disabled.</li>
    <li>To view snapshots in 2x mode, the ROM launcher window must be sized at
      least 1000x760.  If the launcher isn't large enough, an attempt will
      be made to use 1x mode.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following snapshots illustrate the various font sizes and rom info
  zoom levels:</p>

  <p>ROM info viewer in 1x mode, UI sized 800x480, small launcher font:</p>
  <img src="graphics/rominfo_1x_small.png">

  <p>ROM info viewer in 1x mode, UI sized 1000x760, medium launcher font:</p>
  <img src="graphics/rominfo_1x_large.png">

  <p>ROM info viewer in 2x mode, UI sized 1400x900, large launcher font:</p>
  <img src="graphics/rominfo_2x_small.png">

  <p>The text box in the upper right corner can be used to narrow down the
  results in the ROM listing.  When this box is empty, all files are shown
  (subject to the restrictions from the filtering option, explained below).
  Typing characters here will show only those files that match that
  pattern.  For example, typing 'Activision' will show only files that
  contain the word 'Activision' in their name.  This is very useful for
  quickly finding a group of related ROMs.  Note that the search is not
  case sensitive, so you don't need to worry about capital or lower-case
  letters.</p>

  <p>The ROM launcher also contains a context menu, selected by clicking the
  right mouse button anywhere in the current window.  This context menu
  contains the following items:</p>

  <p><ol>
    <li><p><b>Override properties</b>: Selecting this option shows a dialog whereby
    ROM properties can be temporarily overriden.  Selecting options from this
    dialog will cause all ROMs launched after that to use those properties
    you specify.  Clicking <b>Default</b> will disable its functionality,
    and use ROM properties as defined by the ROM itself.  The dialog is as
    follows (See <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#Properties">Game Properties</a></b>
    for more information concerning ROM properties):</p>

    <li><p><b>Filter listing</b>: Selecting this option shows a dialog whereby
    one can filter the types of files shown in the listing.  The dialog is as
    follows:</p>
    <p><img src="graphics/launcher_filter.png"></p>
    <p>Currently, the choices are as follows:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><b>All files</b> - self explanatory, show all files in the ROM
        listing.  This is the default, and emulates the behaviour of
        all previous versions of Stella.</li>
      <li><b>All roms</b> - show only files with a valid ROM extension.
        Currently, this means extensions .a26, .bin, .rom, .gz, .zip.</li>
      <li><b>ROMs ending with</b> - show only files with a ROM extension
        as selected from the checkboxes.</li>
      </ul></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Reload listing</b>: Selecting this performs a reload of the
    current listing.  It is an alternative to pressing the Control-r
    key combo.</li>
  </ol></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="ROMAudit">5. ROM Audit Mode</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella has the ability to rename all your ROMs according to the name
  specified in the properties database.  This is useful if you've downloaded
  ROMs in DOS 8.3 naming format, and wish the filenames to be more descriptive,
  or the current filenames are too large to see in the launcher.</p>

  <p>This feature is accessible from <b>Options =&gt; Audit ROMs</b>, and is only
  available while in ROM launcher mode.  The dialog box for this feature
  is as follows:</p>
  <img src="graphics/romaudit.png">

  <p>Simply select the ROM path with the 'Audit path' button, and click the
  'Audit' button.  The ROMs will then be renamed according to their internal
  properties.  When the operation is complete, the number of ROMs that were
  renamed (as well as ones that weren't) will be shown.</p>

  <p>There are several items to take note of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>THIS OPERATION CANNOT BE UNDONE</b>.  I cannot stress this
      enough; if you aren't completely sure you want to rename your ROMs,
      don't use this function.  There is no undo feature, and one won't be
      added.</li>
    <li>Only filenames that Stella considers to be valid ROMs will be
      considered.  Currently, this means files that end in '.a26',
      '.bin', '.rom', '.gz' and '.zip'.  Files which don't have these
      extensions will be ignored.</li>
    <li>If a valid ROM doesn't have a properties entry, it will be
      ignored.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Adaptor">6. Stelladaptor/2600-daptor Support</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella supports real Atari 2600 joysticks, paddles and driving controllers
  using the <a href="http://www.stelladaptor.com">Stelladaptor</a> and
  <a href="http://2600-daptor.com">2600-adaptor</a> devices.</p>

  <p>Stella can use up to <b>two</b> adaptors; any extra ones are ignored.
  Stelladaptor devices will be automatically detected and configured.  Devices
  can be plugged/unplugged while the emulator is running, although you will need
  to restart the game currently being emulated.</p>

  <p>The detection and configuration is as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>The first device found will act as the <b>left game port</b>
    on a real Atari.  Depending on the device, Stella will detect it as
    either the left joystick, paddles 0 & 1, or the left driving controller.</li>

    <li>The second device found will act as the <b>right game port</b>
    on a real Atari.  Depending on the device, Stella will detect it as
    either the right joystick, paddles 2 & 3, or the right driving controller.</li>

    <li>Any other devices will be ignored.</li>

    <li>The assignment ordering of Stelladaptor/2600-daptor to port can be redefined with
    'sa1' and 'sa2' (see description in 'Starting a Game').</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="AtariVox">7. AtariVox/SaveKey Support</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella supports a real AtariVox device for the speech/SpeakJet portion
  of the controller.  You will need a real AtariVox device, located
  <a href="http://www.richard.hutchinson.dsl.pipex.com/new_page_5.htm">here</a>,
  as well as some means of connecting it to your computer (some sort of
  serial port/USB adaptor).  There should be drivers for your serial convertor,
  which allow your particular operating system to 'see' the device (configuring
  this is outside the scope of this document).  Once your operating system
  properly detects the AtariVox, you will need to tell Stella which serial
  port it is connected to.  This is done by using the '-avoxport' commandline
  argument, or by setting it in the UI under the 'Devices & Ports' tab in
  <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#Remapping">Input Devices</a></b>.</p>

  <p>Note that you must use the entire name of the port as specified by
  your operating system.  For example, in Windows this would be COM1,
  COM2, etc; Linux and MacOSX tend to use names similar to '/dev/xxxxxx'.
  For now, only Linux/UNIX, MacOSX, and Windows are supported.</p>

  <p>Support for the EEPROM portion of the AtariVox and SaveKey is currently
  emulated.  That is, a file will be created on your computer simulating the
  EEPROM; the actual EEPROM hardware itself will not be accessed or modified.
  This is very useful in the testing stages of creating a new game, since
  writing to a real EEPROM many times will eventually wear it out.</p>

  <p>The location of the EEPROM files are configurable through the
  '<i>-eepromdir</i>' commandline argument and within the application itself
  (see <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#ConfigFiles">Config Files</a></b>).
  If the path for these files hasn't been set, the default location will depend on the
  version of Stella, as follows:</p>

  <p><table cellpadding="5" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Linux/Unix</b></td>
      <td><i>~/.stella/atarivox_eeprom.dat<br>
        ~/.stella/savekey_eeprom.dat</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Macintosh</b></td>
      <td><i>~/Library/Application Support/Stella/atarivox_eeprom.dat<br>
        ~/Library/Application Support/Stella/savekey_eeprom.dat</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Windows</b></td>
      <td><i>%APPDATA%\Stella\atarivox_eeprom.dat<br>
        %APPDATA%\Stella\savekey_eeprom.dat</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>OR</b><br>
        <i>_BASEDIR_\atarivox_eeprom.dat<br>
          _BASEDIR_\savekey_eeprom.dat<br></i>
          (if a file named 'basedir.txt' exists in the application
          directory containing the full pathname for _BASEDIR_)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that these EEPROM files will be created when necessary, and
  initialized as a real EEPROM would be (containing all $FF).  The
  files can be manually deleted, which is very useful in testing
  cases where a ROM is accessing the EEPROM for the first time.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Debugger">8. Developer Options/Integrated Debugger</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Many options are available for ROM developers, which are described in
  different sections of this manual, as follows:</p>

  <p><ul>
    <li>Developer key-combo shortcuts, used to change TIA state dynamically
    (ie, while the emulation is still running).  See <b>Keyboard Layout - 
    <a href="#DeveloperKeys">Developer Keys in TIA mode</a></b> for more information.</li>

    <li>Commandline options influencing emulation state.  See <b>Using the Command Line - 
    <a href="#DeveloperCommandLine">Developer Commands</a></b> for more information.</li>

    <li>Viewing TIA/console information overlaid on the TIA image.  This option
    can be enabled from the commandline or using the Alt-L key combo,
    and is extremely useful for viewing the current scanline count and associated
    frames per second, bankswitch and display formats, etc.  The following shows
    an example of this information:
    <p><img src="graphics/developer_stats.png"></p>
    <p>The two lines of output describe the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Number of scanlines in current frame, associated framerate, and
        resulting display format.  Note that the framerate shown is the
        <i>internal</i>, virtual framerate (it's calculated from the
        number of scanlines).  If the '*' character is present, it means
        the display format was auto-detected as shown.  For the given example,
        the format was auto-detected as 'NTSC'.</li>
      <li>Cartridge information.  If the '*' character is present,
        it means the bankswitch format was auto-detected as shown.  The item
        in round brackets indicates ROM size.  For the given example,
        the bankswitch type was auto-detected as 4K, and the file size was
        4K (4096 bytes).</li>
      </li>
    </ol></p></li>
  </ul></p>

  <p>Finally, Stella contains an extensive, built-in debugger.  Have a look at
  <a href="debugger.html">this page</a> for integrated debugger documentation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Settings">9. Settings File</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella will remember when you change a setting either at the command line
  or while the emulation is running, and use the settings the next time
  you start the emulator.  The settings are saved in a text file which can
  be edited outside of Stella.  This file can contain your default options,
  and eliminates the need to specify them on the command line.  Any
  options specified on the command line will override those in the settings file.</p>

  <p>The syntax for the settings file is very straightforward.  Any line starting with
  a ';' character is considered a comment and is ignored.  Other lines must be of
  the form: <b>command = value</b>, where <i>command</i> is the same as that
  specified on the command line (without the '-' character), and <i>value</i>
  is dependent on the command.</p>

  <p>For example, the following table illustrates how command line and settings entries
  are similar:</p>

  <table BORDER=2>
    <tr>
      <th>Command Line</th>
      <th>Settings File</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>-video gl</td>
      <td>video = gl</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>-volume 75</td>
      <td>volume = 75</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>-showinfo 1</td>
      <td>showinfo = 1 (or showinfo = true)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The settings file has a special name/location depending on which version of Stella
  you use, which is currently not configurable:</p>

  <p><table cellpadding="5" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Linux/Unix</b></td>
      <td><i>$HOME/.stella/stellarc</i></td>

          (if a file named 'basedir.txt' exists in the application
          directory containing the full pathname for _BASEDIR_)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Cheats">10. Cheatcode Manager</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella contains support for Bob Colbert's Cheetah cheat codes, as
  well as an extended Stella-specific type of cheat code that works on
  bankswitched ROMs.</p>

  <p>To add/remove/edit a cheat code, enter the 'Cheat Code' dialog:<br><br>
  <img src="graphics/cheat.png">

  <p>Currently, there are three types of cheatcodes available, all of which
  must be entered in hexidecimal format:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Per-frame RAM cheats:<br>
      Evaluated each frame, and apply to RAM only.  Format as follows:
  <pre>
   4-digit code: c041
   c0 = address
   41 = data
  </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Cheetah codes, which are explained in detail on
      <a href="http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/">Bob Colbert's web page</a>,
      along with a list of codes for various games.  Cheetah codes
      don't support bankswitched ROMs, so they only work for 2K or 4K ROMs.
      Format as follows:
  <pre>
   6-digit (cheetah) code: aaaddc
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1
  </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Stella extended cheats are similar to Cheetah codes, except that
      they can be 7 or 8 digits long, with the extra digits used for the
      bank number:
  <pre>
   7-digit (stella) code: baaaddc
   b = bank (0 to $f)
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1

   8-digit (stella) code: bbaaaddc
   bb = bank (0 to $ff)
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1
  </pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>There's also the concept of <i>one shot</i> codes.  These codes work
  exactly the same as above, except they aren't saved.  They are evaluated
  once and immediately discarded.

  <p>Here are a few cheat codes we've found:</p>
  <pre>
Pitfall (standard Cheetah codes):
   5b0ea1 - infinite lives
   723ea1 - infinite time
   aa5??0 - set starting level, ?? = 01 to ff (d0 is kinda neat)

Battlezone (Stella extended codes):
   1236ea1 - infinite lives

Ms Pac-Man (Stella extended codes):
   108fea1 - infinite lives
  </pre>

  <p>The name of the cheat database file is configurable through the
  '<i>-cheatfile</i>' commandline argument and within the application itself
  (see <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#ConfigFiles">Config Files</a></b>).  If the
  path for this file hasn't been set, the default filename will depend on the
  version of Stella, as follows:</p>

  <p>Stella will require a restart for changes to this file to take effect.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b><a name="Properties">11. Game Properties</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Stella uses game properties to specify the "best" emulator settings for a
  game. As of version 2.2 of Stella, a default database of properties are
  built-in, but you may modify these through the use of a <b>stella.pro</b> file.
  This file will contain all properties modified by the user.  So this
  means that when you upgrade Stella, your personal properties settings are
  preserved.</p>

  <p>
  <h2><b>Property File</b></h2>

  <p>A property file consists of some number of blocks.  Each block in the file
  contains the properties for a single game.  For example the general format of
  a property file is:</p>

  <p>
  <pre>
   ; Comments
   "Cartridge.MD5"      "Value"
   "Property"           "Value"
   ""

   ; Comments
   "Cartridge.MD5"      "Value"
   "Property"           "Value"
   ""

   . . .

   ; Comments
   "Cartridge.MD5"      "Value"
   "Property"           "Value"
   ""</pre>

  <p>Every block in the property file must have a unique value for the
  <i>Cartridge.MD5</i> property.</p>

  <p>
  <h2><b>Properties</b></h2>

  <p>Each block in a property file consists of a set of properties for a single
  game.  Stella supports the properties described below:</p>

  <table CELLSPACING="10">
    <tr>
      <td VALIGN="TOP"><i>Cartridge.MD5:</i></td>
      <td>Indicates the MD5 checksum of the ROM image as a
      string of hexadecimal digits.  Stella uses this property while
      attempting to match a game with its block of properties.  If the
      value of the property matches the MD5 checksum of the ROM image then
      Stella uses that block of properties for the game.  You can use the
      GNU md5sum program, which is included with most Linux distributions,
      to calculate the MD5 checksum of a ROM image.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td VALIGN="TOP"><i>Cartridge.Manufacturer:</i></td>
      <td>Indicates the game's manufacturer.</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Indicates the manufacturer's model number for the game.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

  <h2><b><a name="Palette">12. Palette Support</a></b></h2>
  <blockquote>

  <p>An Atari 2600 palette consists of 128 colours, which are different
  for the three major television standards (NTSC, PAL, SECAM).
  Stella supports two built-in palettes and one user-defined palette for each format.
  These are set using the '-palette' option, and are described as follows:</p>
  <p><table cellpadding="5" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><b>standard</b></td>
      <td>The default palette from Stella 1.4 onwards.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>z26</b></td>
      <td>The palette from the z26 emulator.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>user</b></td>
      <td>An external palette file, supplied by the user.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>A user-defined palette has certain restrictions, further described as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>The palette file must be at least 792 bytes long.  Colours are stored
      in 24-bit RGB, with the first byte for red, the second for green, the
      third for blue, for a total of 3 bytes per colour.</li>
    <li>The first 384 bytes of the file (128 * 3) will be used for the NTSC
      palette.  The next 384 bytes (128 * 3) will be for the PAL palette.
      The next 24 bytes (8 * 3) will be for the SECAM palette, which
      consists of eight distinct colours.  Any extra data in the file
      will be ignored.</li>
    <li>The PAL colour-loss effect is calculated within Stella.  You do not
      need to specify those colours in the palette file.
  </ul>

  <p>The name of the palette file is configurable through the
  '<i>-palettefile</i>' commandline argument and within the application itself
  (see <b>Advanced Configuration - <a href="#ConfigFiles">Config Files</a></b>).  If the
  path for this file hasn't been set, the default filename will depend on the
  version of Stella, as follows:</p>

  <p><table cellpadding="5" border="1">

          directory containing the full pathname for _BASEDIR_)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Note that to actually use the external palette, the palette file must
  exist and be valid, <b>and</b> the palette option should be set to <i>user</i>
  (in <b>Video Settings</b> dialog).  The current ROM will have to be reloaded
  for changes to this file to take effect.</p>

  <p>Bradford W. Mott started developing Stella during the fall of 1995, and Stephen
  Anthony has maintained the project since around 2004. Over the years, a number of people
  from around the world have contributed to the project.
  Some people have provided technical help while others have offered suggestions
  and praise.  The Stella Team is grateful for all the help and support it has
  received over the years.  The following is an incomplete list of the people who have
  played a part in bringing Stella to you.  If I've missed someone, please let

<H2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<P>
Version 2, June 1991

</P>

<PRE>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>



<H2>Preamble</H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>


<H2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>


<P>

<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<P>

<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>

<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>

<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</UL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<P>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</UL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>

<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<P>

<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<P>

<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<P>

<STRONG>7.</STRONG>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<P>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<P>


<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<P>

<STRONG>11.</STRONG>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<P>

<STRONG>12.</STRONG>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
